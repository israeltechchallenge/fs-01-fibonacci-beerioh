// Create a simple website that presents the following text: “The Fibonacci of X is Y”, where X & Y are numbers declared in your JS code (should present numbers instead of letters)
// X is the index of the fibonacci number Y in the sequence. 
// X and Y should be declared as JS variables. Both X and Y should be added to the HTML with JavaScript - do not write the value of X and Y directly in your HTML code, use Javascript manipulate the HTML
